# Wheat Kernel Clustering 3D
A project for Machine Learning Spring 2025. This project contains three files: _Seed_Data.csv_, _DBSCANViz.py,_ and __Clustering.py_.

**Seed_Data.csv**: the dataset taken from the [Seeds UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dongeorge/seed-from-uci) repository. It contains information about a kernel's width, height, ratio, compactness, and more; however, this project only uses the first three.

**DBSCANViz.py**: an additional file for testing with the DBSCAN algorithm. Since this project uses KMeans, it d
